# my-Website
In this project, I'm aiming to create a duplicate version of this website http://ka11away.com/

My goal isn't to try to create the website completely on my own but rather look at Alexander's code and go through it step by step through out the whole process of making the website to really examine the decisions he had made to create and style certain elements and the reasons behind them
